Great question! Hereâ€™s a brief overview to clarify the differences:

- **Laws**: These are the broadest category and refer to the system of rules that a country or community recognizes as regulating the actions of its members. They are established by a legislative body (like Congress) and can include statutes, regulations, and case law.

- **Statutes**: These are specific types of laws that have been written and passed by a legislative body. For example, the United States Congress enacts federal statutes, while state legislatures enact state statutes. Statutes are codified in books of laws, like the United States Code.

- **Rules**: These are more specific directives created by government agencies based on the authority given to them by statutes. Rules are also known as regulations. They provide detailed guidance on how the statutes should be implemented and enforced. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) creates rules to enforce environmental laws.

In essence:
- Laws are the overarching system.
- Statutes are specific laws passed by legislative bodies.
- Rules (or regulations) are detailed directives created by government agencies to implement statutes.

I hope that helps! If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.

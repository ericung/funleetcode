Section 851 of Title 21 of the United States Code outlines the procedures for establishing prior convictions in federal drug cases. Essentially, it allows for enhanced penalties for repeat offenders. Here's a brief overview:

1. **Filing an Information**: Before trial or a guilty plea, the U.S. Attorney must file an information stating the prior convictions that justify the enhanced penalties.
2. **Affirmation or Denial**: After conviction but before sentencing, the court asks the defendant if they affirm or deny the prior convictions.
3. **Hearing**: If the defendant denies the prior convictions, a hearing is held to determine the validity of those convictions.

This section is often referred to as the "851 enhancement" and can significantly increase the mandatory minimum sentences for repeat drug offenders.

## **Court Proceedings**

- The **Full Federal Court** upheld the initial decision.

### **High Court of Australia**

## **High Court Judgment**

### **Decision Overview**

- The High Court dismissed the appeal by Mr. Fischer.
- **Unanimous Decision**: All justices agreed on the outcome.

### **Reasoning**

1. **No Immediate Beneficial Ownership Transfer**:
   - The Deed of Appointment did not immediately transfer beneficial ownership to the children.
   - The lack of immediate changes in control and the retention of benefits by the parents indicated no actual transfer.

2. **CGT Event Timing**:
   - The CGT event occurred when the **legal title** was transferred, not at the time of the Deed of Appointment.
   - For tax purposes, the **disposal of assets** happens upon the change of legal ownership.

3. **Trust Deed Interpretation**:
   - The powers exercised under the trust deed did not result in an immediate vesting of the assets to the beneficiaries.

### **Implications of the Decision**

- **Clarification on Trust Distributions**:
  - Merely executing documents like a Deed of Appointment is insufficient without accompanying actions that reflect a change in ownership.

- **Taxation Consequences**:
  - Trustees and beneficiaries need to be aware that the timing of asset transfers affects tax liabilities.
  - Intentions must be matched with actual legal changes to be effective for tax purposes.

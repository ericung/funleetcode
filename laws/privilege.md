### **Definition of Legal Privilege**

In the legal context, **privilege** refers to a special legal right or immunity granted to a person or entity, which allows them to **refuse to disclose certain confidential communications** or information in legal proceedings. This means that certain communications are protected from being disclosed during litigation, even if they are relevant to the case.

As a lawyer, using presentations with chaining is more effective than simply handing out a piece of paper due to several key reasons:

### Enhanced Clarity and Cohesion:
- **Chaining:** Helps create a logical and clear progression of ideas. By connecting various legal principles and precedents, the lawyer can illustrate how each point supports the overall argument.
- **Paper:** Can be dense and harder to follow without the context and verbal explanation provided by a presentation.

### Increased Engagement:
- **Chaining:** Keeps the audience engaged by building a narrative. Lawyers can use emphasis, tone, and body language to highlight key points and make the argument more compelling.
- **Paper:** May not capture the audience's attention as effectively and can be less engaging.

### Real-Time Adaptability:
- **Chaining:** Allows the lawyer to adapt and respond to questions or counterarguments in real-time, reinforcing the argument dynamically.
- **Paper:** Is static and cannot address immediate queries or objections.

### Persuasive Power:
- **Chaining:** Enables the lawyer to use rhetorical devices, storytelling, and visual aids to persuade the audience. The continuous connection of ideas helps to reinforce the strength of the argument.
- **Paper:** Relies solely on the written word, which may not be as persuasive without the additional context and emphasis provided by a presentation.

### Interactive Support:
- **Chaining:** Facilitates interaction and engagement with the audience, allowing for a deeper understanding of the legal argument.
- **Paper:** Lacks the interactive element, which can limit comprehension and retention.

### Use of Visual Aids:
- **Chaining:** Presentations can include visual aids such as charts, diagrams, and slides that illustrate the connections between various laws and precedents. These visuals can make complex legal concepts more accessible.
- **Paper:** While it can include visual elements, it may not be as effective without the lawyer's explanation.

### Example in Practice:
Imagine you are presenting a legal argument in a court hearing:
- You start by outlining the foundational principles (e.g., constitutional provisions).
- You then introduce relevant statutes and regulations, showing how they build upon the foundational principles.
- Next, you cite case law that interprets these statutes, connecting each precedent to your overall argument.
- You apply these laws to the specific facts of your case, demonstrating a clear and cohesive progression of ideas.
- Throughout the presentation, you use visual aids, engage with the audience, and address any counterarguments dynamically.

### Conclusion:
While handing out a piece of paper can provide valuable information, a presentation using chaining is often more effective in clearly communicating, engaging the audience, and persuasively making the argument. The interactive and dynamic nature of a presentation allows for a deeper connection with the audience and a more impactful delivery of the legal argument.

Sure, let's break down both cases:

### Washington v. Harper (1990)
In this case, Walter Harper, an inmate in the Washington state prison system, was involuntarily medicated with antipsychotic drugs against his will. Harper had a history of violent behavior and mental illness. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the state could administer such medication to a competent, nonconsenting inmate only if it proved by "clear, cogent, and convincing" evidence that the medication was necessary and effective for furthering a compelling state interest - Justia US Supreme Court Center](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/494/210/). The Court found that the use of an internal institutional review was adequate under the lesser standard of review embodied in Turner v. Safely.

### Blake Decision (2021)
In the case of State v. Blake, the Washington State Supreme Court declared the state's simple possession of a controlled substance statute (RCW 69.50.4013) unconstitutional because it violated the due process clause. The statute criminalized unknowing drug possession, meaning people could be arrested and convicted even if they did not realize they had drugs in their possession. The court ruled that the legislature's police power did not extend that far. As a result, all previous convictions under this statute were invalidated.

Section 253B.17 of the Minnesota Statutes deals with **petitions for judicial determination** regarding the release or continued commitment of individuals who have been committed due to mental illness or other conditions. Here are the key points:

1. **Petition for Release**: Any patient, except those committed as sexually dangerous persons or those deemed dangerous to the public, can petition the court for release from commitment. This petition can be filed by the patient or an interested person.

2. **Petition for Hearing**: Patients can also petition for a hearing concerning the administration of neuroleptic medication.

3. **Notice of Hearing**: Upon filing the petition, the court sets a hearing date and provides ten days' notice to relevant parties, including the patient, county attorney, and head of the treatment facility.

4. **Court Examiners**: The court appoints a court examiner, and at the patient's request, a second examiner can be appointed. These examiners provide reports to the court before the hearing.

5. **Evidence and Hearing**: During the hearing, the patient, their counsel, the petitioner, and the county attorney can present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.

6. **Order**: After the hearing, the court issues an order stating its findings and decision, which is then communicated to the treatment facility.

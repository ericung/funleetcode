The legality of sleeper agents largely depends on the jurisdiction and the specific actions they take. Generally, sleeper agents are spies or operatives who are placed in a target country or organization to act as potential assets if activated in the future. Here are some key points:

### Legal Considerations

1. **Espionage Laws**: In many countries, espionage is illegal and can result in severe penalties, including imprisonment. Sleeper agents who engage in espionage activities, such as gathering classified information or conducting sabotage, are committing crimes under these laws.

2. **National Security**: Sleeper agents can pose significant threats to national security. Governments often have strict laws and counterintelligence measures to detect and neutralize such threats.

3. **International Law**: The legality of sleeper agents can also be influenced by international law and treaties. For example, the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations outlines the legal framework for diplomatic immunity, which can sometimes complicate the prosecution of sleeper agents.

### Examples

- **Jack Barsky**: A Soviet KGB sleeper agent who was active in the United States from 1978 to 1988. He was arrested in 1997 and later cooperated with authorities.
- **Illegals Program**: A network of Russian sleeper spies planted in the US by the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service. A multi-year investigation led to the arrest of 10 suspects in 2010.

### Conclusion

The legality of sleeper agents is complex and varies by jurisdiction. While the act of being a sleeper agent itself may not always be illegal, the activities they engage in, such as espionage and sabotage, are typically criminal offenses.

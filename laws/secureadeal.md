A "vested interest" refers to a personal stake or involvement in an endeavor, often driven by the potential for gain or benefit. This can manifest in various contexts, such as business, politics, or personal relationships. For instance, investors in a company have a vested interest in its success because their financial gains are tied to the company's performance.

# worker's best response to the motion for summary judgment


A worker's best response to a motion for summary judgment in an employment case depends heavily on the specific facts of the case and the arguments being made by the employer. However, here's a general outline of what a strong response should include:

**1. Understand the Motion:**

* **Carefully review the motion:**  Pay close attention to the employer's arguments and the evidence they are presenting. Identify the specific claims or defenses the employer is targeting.
* **Identify the key facts in dispute:** Summary judgment is only appropriate if there are *no genuine disputes* about *material* facts.  The employer will try to argue there aren't any such disputes.  The worker's response needs to show there *are* disputed facts.
* **Understand the legal standard:** Summary judgment is granted when "there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law."  The worker needs to understand this standard and how it applies to their case.

**2. Gather and Organize Evidence:**

* **Assemble all relevant evidence:** This includes documents (emails, performance reviews, policies), witness statements (affidavits), and any other evidence that supports the worker's claims.
* **Organize the evidence clearly:**  Make it easy for the judge to find the evidence that supports the worker's arguments.  Use clear headings and references to specific documents or testimony.

**3. Draft a Strong Opposition:**

* **Address each of the employer's arguments:**  Don't ignore any of the employer's points.  Explain why the employer's arguments are incorrect or incomplete.
* **Highlight the disputed facts:**  Point out specific facts that are in dispute and explain why those facts are material to the outcome of the case.  Cite specific evidence that supports the worker's version of the facts.
* **Present legal arguments:** Explain why the law supports the worker's claims, even if the facts are disputed.  Cite relevant case law and statutes.
* **File a concise and persuasive brief:**  The brief should be well-organized, clearly written, and focused on the key issues in the case.

**4. Supporting Documents:**

* **Affidavits:**  Affidavits from the worker and other witnesses are crucial.  They should be based on personal knowledge and set forth specific facts that support the worker's claims.
* **Exhibits:**  Attach copies of all relevant documents as exhibits to the opposition.  Make sure the exhibits are clearly labeled and referenced in the brief.

**5. Consider Oral Argument:**

* **Request oral argument:**  If possible, request oral argument on the motion. This gives the worker's attorney the opportunity to present their arguments directly to the judge and answer any questions the judge may have.

**Specific Examples in Employment Cases:**

* **Discrimination:** If the worker is claiming discrimination, the response should include evidence of:
    * The worker's protected characteristic (race, sex, age, etc.)
    * Adverse employment action (termination, demotion, etc.)
    * Circumstances suggesting discrimination (e.g., similarly situated employees outside the protected group treated more favorably, discriminatory remarks).
* **Retaliation:** If the worker is claiming retaliation, the response should include evidence of:
    * Protected activity (complaining about discrimination, taking FMLA leave, etc.)
    * Adverse employment action
    * A causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action.
* **Wrongful Termination:**  The worker's response would depend on the reason for the termination.  It would need to show a disputed issue of fact, such as whether the stated reason was pretextual (a cover-up for illegal discrimination), or whether the employer breached an employment contract.

**Crucial Advice:**

* **Consult an attorney:**  It is *essential* for a worker facing a motion for summary judgment to consult with an experienced employment lawyer.  These motions are complex, and a lawyer can help the worker understand the law, gather evidence, and draft a strong opposition.  This is not something a worker should attempt on their own.  The outcome of a summary judgment motion can often determine the entire course of the case.

# motions should never be denied

That statement is absolutely incorrect. Motions are frequently denied by courts, and it's a crucial part of the legal process.  The idea that motions should *never* be denied would create a deeply flawed and unjust system. Here's why:

* **Motions are Requests, Not Demands:** A motion is simply a request to the court to take some action.  It's not a guarantee that the court *must* grant the request.  The opposing party has the right to argue against the motion, and the judge has the duty to consider both sides' arguments and the relevant law.

* **Judicial Discretion:** Judges have discretion in deciding whether to grant or deny motions.  They must consider various factors, including the law, the facts of the case, and principles of fairness and justice.  If every motion were automatically granted, there would be no need for judges to consider them.

* **Preventing Abuse of Process:** If motions were never denied, parties could file frivolous or abusive motions, knowing they would automatically be granted.  This would clog the courts, delay justice, and create unfair outcomes.

* **Ensuring Fairness:** Denying a motion is sometimes the *only* way to ensure a fair trial.  For example, if a party files a motion to suppress evidence that was legally obtained, denying that motion protects the integrity of the fact-finding process.

* **Correcting Errors:** Sometimes, motions are denied because they are procedurally defective, or because the party making the motion has not presented sufficient evidence or legal argument to support their request.  Denying the motion in these cases encourages parties to follow proper procedure and present well-supported arguments.

* **Protecting Rights:**  Motions are often used to protect constitutional rights.  If a party files a motion to exclude illegally obtained evidence, and that motion is *granted*, that protects the defendant's Fourth Amendment rights.  Conversely, if such a motion is improperly *denied*, the defendant's rights would be violated.  Thus, the possibility of denial is essential to protecting rights.

* **Example: Motion for Summary Judgment:**  A motion for summary judgment asks the court to rule in favor of one party *without* a trial.  If such motions were never denied, trials would become obsolete, and many cases that genuinely should be decided by a jury would be decided by a judge based only on the moving party's presentation of evidence.

**In short:** The ability of courts to deny motions is absolutely essential to a fair and just legal system.  It ensures that decisions are based on law and facts, not just on requests from one party.  It prevents abuse of process, protects rights, and ensures the integrity of the judicial system.


# motion should always be denied

The idea that motions should *always* be denied is just as wrong as the idea that they should never be denied.  Such a rule would be completely impractical and would cripple the legal system. Here's why:

* **No Way to Raise Legitimate Issues:** Motions are a critical way for parties to bring important legal issues to the court's attention.  If motions were always denied, there would be no way to challenge improper procedure, inadmissible evidence, or legal errors.

* **No Efficiency:**  Motions can be used to streamline cases and resolve issues efficiently.  For example, a motion to dismiss a frivolous lawsuit can save the parties and the court a great deal of time and expense.  If motions were always denied, such cases would drag on unnecessarily.

* **No Way to Correct Errors:**  Motions are sometimes the only way to correct errors made by the opposing party or even by the court itself.  If motions were always denied, these errors would go uncorrected, leading to unjust outcomes.

* **No Way to Protect Rights:** Motions are frequently used to protect constitutional and other legal rights.  For example, a motion to suppress illegally obtained evidence protects a defendant's Fourth Amendment rights.  If motions were always denied, these rights would be routinely violated.

* **No Summary Judgment:**  Motions for summary judgment are a key tool for resolving cases where there are no genuine disputes of material fact.  If motions were always denied, every case, no matter how clear-cut, would have to go to trial, wasting resources and clogging the courts.

* **No Way to Narrow Issues:** Motions can be used to narrow the issues in a case, making trials more focused and efficient.  If motions were always denied, trials would be longer and more complex than necessary.

* **Example: Motion to Compel Discovery:** If one party refuses to provide necessary information during discovery, the other party can file a motion to compel.  If such motions were always denied, one party could obstruct the entire discovery process, making it impossible for the other side to prepare for trial.

**In short:** The ability of courts to *grant* motions is absolutely essential to a fair and efficient legal system.  Motions are a vital tool for raising legal issues, correcting errors, protecting rights, and streamlining cases.  A system where motions were always denied would be just as dysfunctional and unfair as one where they were always granted.  The key is that judges must carefully consider each motion on its merits and make a decision based on the law and the facts of the case.





# motions can always be re-opened for re-evaluation


The statement that motions can *always* be reopened for re-evaluation is **not entirely true** and can be misleading. While there are some limited circumstances where a court might reconsider a prior ruling on a motion, it's not an automatic or readily available process.  Here's a more nuanced explanation:

**General Principles:**

* **Finality:** Courts strive for finality in their decisions.  Reopening motions too easily would undermine this principle and lead to endless litigation.
* **Law of the Case Doctrine:**  The "law of the case" doctrine generally prevents courts from revisiting issues that have already been decided in the same case, especially at the appellate level. This promotes stability and efficiency.
* **Rule of Procedure:** Specific rules of procedure govern when and how a court can reconsider a prior order.

**Circumstances Where Reconsideration *Might* Be Possible:**

* **New Evidence:** If significant new evidence comes to light that was not previously available, a party might be able to file a motion to reconsider based on this new evidence.  However, the party typically needs to show that they could not have reasonably discovered this evidence earlier.
* **Clear Error:**  A court might reconsider a prior ruling if it is convinced that it made a clear error of law.  This is usually done through a motion to reconsider or a motion for rehearing.
* **Change in Law:** If the law changes after a court's ruling, the court might reconsider its prior decision in light of the new law.
* **Interlocutory Orders:**  Rulings on some *interlocutory* motions (motions made during the course of a case) are sometimes subject to reconsideration by the trial court, as these rulings are not yet final judgments.  However, even here, reconsideration is not guaranteed.
* **Appellate Remand:**  If an appellate court remands a case back to the trial court for further proceedings, the trial court might have the opportunity to revisit some prior rulings in light of the appellate court's instructions.

**Limitations and Restrictions:**

* **Time Limits:**  There are often strict time limits for filing motions to reconsider.  Missing these deadlines can bar a party from seeking reconsideration.
* **Standards:**  Courts typically have specific standards that must be met before they will reconsider a prior ruling.  It's not enough to simply reargue the same points; the moving party must usually show new evidence, a clear error, or a change in law.
* **Reluctance to Revisit:** Courts are generally reluctant to revisit prior rulings, especially if the issue has already been fully litigated.  There's a strong presumption that prior decisions are correct.

**Key Takeaway:**

While it's *sometimes* possible to reopen a motion for re-evaluation, it's not something that can be done routinely or easily.  Reconsideration is generally disfavored and is only granted in limited circumstances, typically involving new evidence, a clear error, or a change in law.  It's important to understand the specific rules and standards in the relevant jurisdiction before attempting to reopen a motion.  Don't assume that just because a motion was denied once, you can simply try again later.


# cross-motions


In legal proceedings, "cross-motions" refer to situations where both parties in a lawsuit file motions with the court, often related to the same issue. It's like each side saying, "No, *I'm* right, and here's why!"

Here's a breakdown of how cross-motions work and what they mean:

**What are Motions?**

* A motion is a formal request to the court to take some action. It could be a request to dismiss the case, to allow certain evidence, to order the other party to do something, or many other things.

**Why Cross-Motions Occur:**

* **Disagreement on an Issue:** When parties disagree on a particular point of law or fact, they might each file a motion arguing their side.
* **Seeking Similar Relief:** Sometimes, both parties might be seeking the same type of relief but for different reasons. For example, both sides might file motions for summary judgment, arguing that there is no need for a trial and that they should win the case.
* **Strategic Maneuvering:** Cross-motions can also be a strategic tool, allowing each party to present their arguments forcefully and potentially gain an advantage in the case.

**How Cross-Motions are Handled:**

* **Simultaneous Consideration:** Courts often consider cross-motions together, as they usually involve related issues.
* **Briefing and Argument:** Each party will file briefs supporting their motion and opposing the other party's motion. The court may also hold oral arguments to allow the parties to present their cases in person.
* **Court's Decision:** The court will then rule on both motions, granting or denying them as appropriate. It's possible for the court to grant one motion and deny the other, or to grant or deny both motions in whole or in part.

**Example:**

Imagine a case where the plaintiff claims the defendant breached a contract.

* The defendant files a motion for summary judgment, arguing that there was no valid contract.
* The plaintiff files a cross-motion for summary judgment, arguing that there was a valid contract and the defendant breached it.

In this scenario, the court would consider both motions together. It might:

* Grant the defendant's motion and dismiss the case, finding that there was no valid contract.
* Deny the defendant's motion and grant the plaintiff's motion, finding that there was a valid contract and the defendant breached it.
* Deny both motions, finding that there are genuine disputes of material fact that require a trial.

**Key Takeaways:**

* Cross-motions are a common occurrence in litigation, especially when parties disagree on key issues.
* They allow both sides to present their arguments to the court.
* The court will consider both motions together and make a ruling based on the law and the facts of the case.

Cross-motions are a vital part of the adversarial legal system, allowing each party to advocate for their position and ensuring that the court has a full understanding of the issues before making a decision.

# Fun Leetcode

## Notes

this is just to keep my skills sharp 

c problems are difficult in that they don't have standard libraries for abstract classes
- in fact, most functionality in c requires thorough understanding of not just pointers and references but in depth skills in manipulating arrays

- standard and useful functions: malloc, sizeof

- string functions: strlen, strcpy, strcmp, strncpy, isspace, isalnum, tolower, strtoll

- a proper string might have an ending character '\0'

- sorting algorithm, qsort(array, size of array, size of character, compare function)

structs
```c
struct structName{
    type variableName;
};
```

type template
```
returnType functionName(parameterType1 parameter1,...,parameterTypeN parameterN);
```

### Rules of Business After a Decade in the Field

Its mostly old stuff spun up again.

1.	There’s always work.

2.	Every primary responsibility of each position of the company can only
be in action for a short period of time. The real heavy lifting of a job only
takes a few moments to complete. Respect the janitor.

3.	You don’t have to prove yourself - but you probably should.

4.	When you win once, everyone will get off your case - for a while.

5.	Immigrants are establishing roots and sorting themselves out. Be open to
people outside your usual circle of friends and family. Be nice to the new
guy. 

6.	Some people are trying to make a name for themselves – for better or
worse but mostly for good. Winning honors for the family isn’t as easy as it
seems.

7.	You might look like a movie star but you’re not them. Everyone is
special.

8.	It takes a village to raise a child. If someone acts the way they are
and does the things the way they do, it isn’t just because of their parents.

9.	Make mistakes early in your career because no one takes you seriously.

10.	If you’re going to go all out, make sure you find somewhere to lay
low.

11.	If you take the back door most of your career you should be careful
about someone who built their career taking the front entrance. The opposite
is true too. Don’t underestimate anyone.

12.	If you play dirty, someone from left field is going to play dirtier.
As a reminder, street justice is real and there’s bad blood in every
neighborhood. There’s history everywhere and ancient rituals are still a
thing.

13.	You either need more lawyers the higher up you go or policemen. You
should choose lawyers whenever you can because good police officers are really
busy people. Good cops are in uniform so don’t waste people’s time.

14.	You can’t wear a red tie for too long. Figure out when to be
aggressive.

15.	It’s tougher to wear a suit in the beginning but you can always wear a
sweater later. It’s tough in the beginning especially if you’re ambitious.

16.	Don’t kill the competition once you identify them.

17.	Good people exist and want to help you succeed without strings
attached or trade offs. Be nice to everyone.

18.	How you move up in the world is important. Be yourself.

19.	You might have the same position as everyone else in the company and
want to get promoted too, but you need to have your own vision that you
develop yourself to be successful. Equivalently, everyone gets promoted
eventually. On the other hand, know when to quit.

20.	Anyone can get laid off at any time – whether they are good or bad.

21.	How brothers interact with each other determines where they’ll be.
Brothers are either dragging each other down or helping each other up. The
worst person on the team is the best person on the team.

22.	Mom cares about her children first. You were hired for a reason.

23.	Nepotism is a double-edged sword. At the end of the day, good people
are hard to come by.

24.	School isn’t over once you leave. Keep learning. You can always go
back to school.
